## GitHub things ##

### Social Coding
- GitHub is a "web-based hosting service for version control using Git", as so eloquently put in the [GitHub Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub)
- Provides the social aspects like
    - Issues (for tracking bugs, feature requests, etc., with conversations in them)
    - Subscription to \<things>, like to Issues, repositories, etc.
    - Notifications of things like @ mentions
    - in-line "meta" comments in committed code (ability to make comments on the site, at a particular line of a commit, external to the code itself)
- Adds workflows for team management of a repository (Pull-requests from within the team and the likes)
- Adds workflows for public contributions to a repository (Fork, then Pull-request from public contributor)
- Presents graphs for several aspects of the code (commits, contributors, "network" (branch timeline visualization), more)
- Supplies web interface for a repository's documentation (especially useful for Markdown-formatted docs)
- Enables diff visualizations of committed code; example:  the commit to [Fix Rename-Item -Path with wildcard char](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/commit/caad7ed471d46629f155a2c7ccbbafa4ffc29355)
- Provides location at which to create Releases
- ..and much more

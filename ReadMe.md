# GitLearning
Some items for learning Git and GitHub.

## What
We want to be able to maximize our freedom to boldly create content, iterate quickly, experiment safely, and collaborate widely.

We can remove fear, tentativeness, worry, doubt by creating a safe content haven through/into/around which we can easily navigate.

## Why
Have such a solid/robust content/versioning store enables us to try new things, commit to them if they work, or revert changes if they do not.

We also generate the benefits of:
- **visibility**: comparing versions to understand what changed when, by whom, and why;
- **step-wise progress**: small, incremental changes to our content, which helps us increment towards ever more awesome things
- **collaboration**: collaborating with others on the same project and even the same code
- **distribution**: we can easily get exactly the code that we want and need via the version control tools

Quick examples:
- visibility: see [history of changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/commits/master)
- step-wise progress: drill down to [one change](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/commit/177921ed63191d71665d303e76ccdbae64d80822)
- collaboration: at the [commit level](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/commit/a3d5bfc401fe94fb8fa4606ce7ca9beb2f3ca712) on up to [Issues](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues) and [Pull Requests](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pulls)

## How
- To create this freedom, we put our content/code into a version control system, like Git
- To have a hub at which the points of collaboration can happen, we use a social coding depot, like GitHub. See [GitHubLearningItems.md](./GitHubLearningItems.md) for info about enabling such collaborations
